### The Problem

The Bitcoin civil war has been raging for quite a while now, and it finally seems like some real steps are being taken toward _something_ of a resolution. My issue is that the resolution we're moving toward may be more detrimental to the health of the ecosystem than the actual scaling problem itself.

While I was working for Bitpay, the most pressing issue in the Bitcoin world was driving adoption by both merchants and investors of all levels. Barring the speculative aspect of cryptocurrency which seems to dominate the market, namely that of Bitcoin (BTC), the main driving force of this adoption is confidence. Merchants won't accept Bitcoin if they lack confidence. Users won't transact it unless they have confidence in its success.
