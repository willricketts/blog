Good beers. You really have to have good beers to get through a Northwest Winter on a 28-foot sailboat. Stouts, porters, and nitro English bitters are all I craved all winter in the evenings spent winding down in the small cabin lit with old fashioned brass lanterns. All of my friends and family thought me to be crazy, moving onto my sailboat and giving up my cliffside rental complete with a sweeping view of Bellingham Bay. The view of the bay was nice, though I considered it quite an upgrade to move into the marina. Seeing the sun come up over the slew of masts and flybridges with the sound of halyards slapping aluminum and wood in the wind was a very gratifying experience. It was living on the most comfortable part of "the fringe".

##### I really love the above picture. My first sailboat is the Gypsea Rose on the right. My current boat, Sanity is in the middle.
