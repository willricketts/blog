### Hello!

I'm Will, a software engineer living in Northwest Washington. Living in Atlanta in 2016, I made the decision to pursue fully remote work in the software industry, left the city, and moved to a small town near the [North Cascades](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1722&bih=1702&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=K09aW9mlBeGd0gKwjqKwBg&q=north+cascades+national+park&oq=north+cascades+&gs_l=img.3.0.0l10.57269.59502.0.60214.17.12.1.4.4.0.124.865.10j2.12.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.17.878...0i67k1j0i10i24k1.0.i7UDV4K3aoI). I live on my sailboat and spend my time working in Elixir/Phoenix, Ruby/Rails, tinkering with RaspberryPi, sailing, motorcycling around the [mountains](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1722&bih=1702&ei=I09aW_KyL4yH8APl9oXYDw&q=mt+baker+wilderness&oq=mt+baker+wilder&gs_l=img.3.0.0l2j0i24k1l6.606.6058.0.6681.43.30.1.12.12.0.161.2733.16j11.27.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..4.39.2687.0..35i39k1j0i30k1j0i5i30k1.0.86rPgRjhVQU), and climbing.
